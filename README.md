# MyReads Project

This is my take on the first project in the advanced web development nanodegree by udacity. This simple app aims at organizing the books you're reading or want to read or having already read and can give you the ability to add more books to those categories.

## Try it

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
